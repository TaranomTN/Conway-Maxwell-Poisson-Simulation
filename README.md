A simulation of **Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (CMP) Neural Network models** for count data prediction, implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook.

This project demonstrates how to simulate and evaluate CMP-based neural networks for modeling overdispersed or underdispersed count data â€” common in fields like epidemiology, finance, and social sciences.

## ğŸ“Œ Overview

The **Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (CMP)** distribution is a generalization of the Poisson distribution that can model both overdispersion (variance > mean) and underdispersion (variance < mean). This notebook implements a neural network framework where the output layer uses the CMP likelihood function to predict count outcomes.
